# Predicting Airbnb Guest Ratings Using Machine Learning Modeling

## 1. Abstract
This exercise proposes the use of predictive machine learning modeling to estimate the guest ratings at Airbnb stays based on various features. The data is a random sample of a dataframe gathered from stays in the city of London, England on November 5th, 2019. The model contains various features representing the host(s), rules, location, etc and other information of the stay itself. Using machine learning techniques, we develop a model to predict guest ratings with a reasonable level of accuracy. Our findings suggest that certain factors, such as price, location, and host response time, have a significant impact on the ratings given by guests. The results of this study can be valuable for both hosts looking to optimize their listings and platforms like Airbnb seeking to improve guest satisfaction. Findings suggest that certain factors, such as price, location, and host response time, have a significant impact on the ratings given by guests. 

## 2. Introduction
Airbnb is an online marketplace where customers can book homestays and experiences in various countries. Each time a guest stays at an accommodation they are encouraged to leave review and a score on the experience. One of the main key performance indicators of how successful a host/stay is the rating. It helps future guests make informed decisions and provides feedback to hosts about their service quality. Predicting guest ratings before a booking can help to better inform hosts on the aspects that lead to customer statisfaction. This paper explores the use of machine learning techniques to predict the ratings that guests would give to Airbnb listings, based on historical data from November 5th 2019. The goal is to develop a model that accurately predicts these ratings and offers insights into the factors that most influence guest satisfaction.

## 3. Data Description
The data contains 106 columns and 39.9 million rows, however a random sample was taken due to computational dependencies. 

The data was gathered from stays in the city of London, England on November 5th, 2019. The source of this data was collected and prepared by Inside Airbnb project (http://insideairbnb.com/)

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Data Exploration

Data and necessary libraries were imported. A custom function was created to show the missing data, number of unique values, and the data type for each feature in our dataframe

### 4.2 Data Exploration

Formatting features, data cleaning and dummy variables were created
